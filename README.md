# minesweeper-game
This is a command-line version of the classic Minesweeper game developed using Python. The game randomly places mines on a square grid, and the player must reveal cells without hitting a mine. The game supports two modes:  Hidden Mode: Mines are not shown during play.  Visible Mode: Mines are shown (for debugging or learning purposes).
